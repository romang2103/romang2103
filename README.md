# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Roman  

I'm a recent **Computer Science graduate from Queen Mary University of London (2025)** with a passion for building **practical applications** and a particular interest in **integrating AI into real-world systems**. Over the past few years Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects, from **full-stack web apps** (**Next.js, React, Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB**) to **backend services** with **Python** and **Docker**. My final year project focused on **evaluating small and quantised LLMs** in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, where I built and benchmarked a full pipeline for domain-specific question answering.  

Outside of coursework, Iâ€™ve gained **hands-on experience** through **internships** and **freelance projects**. Iâ€™ve **revamped startup websites**, contributed to **production codebases** using **React/AWS/Postgres/Docker**, led a **team of interns** to develop a society website, and recently built an **AI-powered onboarding pipeline** for a tutoring platform. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to projects that combine **web development** and **AI integration**, and I enjoy designing **clean, scalable systems** that bring new technologies into practical use.
